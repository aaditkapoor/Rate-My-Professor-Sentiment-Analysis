# Rate-My-Professor-Sentiment-Analysis
Tired of reading the reviews of each and every professor? We bring you the solution to your problem.  Our aim is to use Machine Learning to classify each review of a particular professor as POSITIVE (1) or NEGATIVE(0).  This is an app that performs sentiment analysis on each review of a given professor and then counts the number of positives and negatives and neutrals to get a tentative classified response.
